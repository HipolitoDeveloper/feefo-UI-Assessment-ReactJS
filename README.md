# Results achived...

- Creation of a clone as equal as possible from what was sent to me
- Patterning the project, excluding .css, using just styled-component. All styles of the components you can find on .styles files.
- Creating a shared-styles where Wrapper (used as div father) and WrapperItem (used as div child) can be found and customized by props.
- Each time that Wrapper is called the props might be passed as well, but only if is necessary.
- The tests can be found on .test files
- AN index.js was created to each Component. The reason to that is thinking on Git History, by that it'll be easier to build/find history changes on each component.
- The structure created to each component and page is :
  - Component.jsx ==> Where you can find component view
  - Component.styles.js ==> Where you can find component style
  - Component.test.js ==> Where you can find component test
  - index.js ==> Where you can find component exportation

# What I should have done
- Make an adaptative contruction based on page width, changing the flex box from row to column when its necessary.
